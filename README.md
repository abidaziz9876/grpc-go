# Basic Go gRPC Server and Client

This is a basic gRPC server and client written in Go. It is based on the [gRPC Quickstart](https://grpc.io/docs/quickstart/go.html) and [gRPC Basics: Go](https://grpc.io/docs/tutorials/basic/go.html) tutorials.

We have implemented a simple gRPC server and client with the following functionality:
- simple RPC
- server-side streaming RPC
- client-side streaming RPC
- bidirectional streaming RPC
